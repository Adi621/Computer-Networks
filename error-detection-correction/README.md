## Error Detection and Correction

This module focuses on classical error detection and correction mechanisms
used in data communication systems.

### Implemented Techniques
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
- Hamming (7,4) block code

### Key Ideas
- Redundancy for detecting transmission errors
- Polynomial division over GF(2)
- Syndrome-based error correction
- Limitations of single-error correcting codes

### Scope
The implementations emphasize clarity and correctness rather than
performance optimizations.

### Academic Notice
This module contains independent educational implementations.
It does not include official homework questions, submission formats,
or instructor-provided test cases.
