## Design Decisions

### Encoding Strategy
- Simple repetition-based block code
- Redundancy factor configurable

### Decoding Strategy
- Majority voting used for error correction
- Assumes independent bit errors

### Limitations
- Inefficient for large redundancy factors
- Cannot correct burst errors effectively

### Goals
- Demonstrate core channel coding ideas
- Emphasize clarity over performance
