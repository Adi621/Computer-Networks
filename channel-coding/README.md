## Channel Coding

This module focuses on channel coding techniques that introduce redundancy
in transmitted data to improve robustness against noise.

The implementations demonstrate fundamental encoding and decoding concepts
used in digital communication systems.

### Key Concepts
- Redundancy for error resilience
- Block coding principles
- Encoding and decoding pipelines
- Trade-offs between reliability and efficiency

### Scope
The focus is on conceptual clarity and correctness rather than optimized
or hardware-oriented implementations.

### Academic Notice
This module contains independent educational implementations.
It does not include official homework questions, submission formats,
or instructor-provided test cases.
