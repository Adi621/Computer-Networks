# Computer Networks Protocols

This repository showcases independent implementations of fundamental
computer networking and communication algorithms, with a focus on
error detection, error correction, and channel coding techniques.

The projects emphasize clear algorithmic design, bit-level operations,
and correctness under error conditions.

### 🔹 Channel Coding
Implementations related to redundancy and encoding techniques designed
to improve robustness against noise in communication channels.

📁 `channel-coding/`

## Academic Context
The implementations in this repository are **independent educational work**
inspired by academic coursework.

They are intended for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes only.

> This repository does **not** include official homework questions,  
> submission formats, or instructor-provided test cases.
